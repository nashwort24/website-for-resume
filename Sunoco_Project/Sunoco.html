      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Sunoco needed to accurately predict "High Demand" days to optimize inventory and staffing. 
        A standard accuracy score wasn't enough; the business cost of a False Positive (missing out on oil sales) 
        was high, but missing a True Positive (overbuying when demand fell) was worse. 
        The goal was to maximize the <strong>True Positive to False Positive (TP/FP) ratio</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Evaluated Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. CatBoost yielded the best stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Engineering:</strong> defined "High Demand" dynamically as volume above the rolling 70th percentile to account for seasonal shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Created 52-week lag features to capture annual seasonality and included macroeconomic indicators like the "Crack Spread."</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Used <code>TimeSeriesSplit</code> to respect the temporal order of data during training.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully broke the client's benchmark of a 2.0 TP/FP ratio. (ended with a 4.5)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Vizualizations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Covid Shock:</strong> COVID significantly impacted oil demand, as it had a broad effect on the entire economy and travel. It was crucial for our model to take this into account.
        We did this by incorporating a binary indicator variable for the pandemic period into our feature set.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>COVID x The Economy:</strong> COVID didn't just impact oil demand, it literally impacted every facet of the economy. This is why creating a new variable accounting for covid was so important.

      </li>
    </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wild Swings in Demand by Year</strong> Depending on the year, the amount of "high-demand" oil weeks would vary wildly. This is why we ultimately ended up creating a variable that had a rolling 52 week average of "high-demand" weeks.</li>
      </ul>
